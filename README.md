## **Employee Leave Management System**  

### **Project Overview**  
I have developed an **Employee Leave Management System** for my office to streamline leave tracking and management. The system is built using:  

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja2  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Database:** MySQL (connected via `mysql.connector`)  

### **Current Features (User Side)**  
âœ… **User Authentication:** Employees can log in securely.  
âœ… **View Applied Leaves:** Users can track their leave history.  
âœ… **Check Who's on Leave Today:** Displays a list of employees currently on leave.  
âœ… **Apply for Leave:** Users can submit leave requests.  
âœ… **Edit Profile:** Employees can update their personal details.  

### **Upcoming Features (Admin Panel - In Progress)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Admin Dashboard:** View all leave requests.  
ðŸ”¹ **Approve/Reject Leaves:** Manage employee leave applications.  
ðŸ”¹ **Additional Admin Functionalities:** (Suggestions welcome!)  

This is just the **initial phase**, and Iâ€™m open to new **ideas & improvements!** ðŸš€ **Stay tuned for updates.**
